chat.how_to_play.line6=§7These 30 levels in the hall are the §fmainline level§7, which is plain(ﾉ*･ω･)ﾉ
chat.how_to_play.line7=§7In addition, the map has §fEaster Egg Levels§7! There are 10 levels in all and very strange(awa). It's hidden somewhere in the hall. Take your time to find it.(￣y▽,￣)╭ 
chat.how_to_play.line8=§7You can also enter §fTime Limited Levels§7 -- restricts the passage within a specified time, with a total of 5 levels!
chat.how_to_play.line9=§7Of course, we have §fDIY Levels§7, which allow you to custom the scenery, design and even commands! Of course... to unlock it, you should complete mainline levels first ╰(￣ω￣ｏ)

chat.how_to_play.line14=§7Green and yellow levels provide §fHints & Strategies§7 (if you can use them, haha), while red levels offer a §fSkip§7 directly!
chat.how_to_play.line15=§7The overall difficulty of the map is called the "map difficulty," which is determined by what you choose at the beginning!
chat.how_to_play.line16=§7The §fmap difficulty determines what auxiliary functions§7 you can use. There are fewer restrictions when it's easy, but when it's Hard, you can't use anything! (＃°Д°)
chat.how_to_play.line17=§7If you make a mistake, you can change it in the settings! 
chat.how_to_play.line18=§lStatistics

#### Map Rule
chat.map_rule.line1=§bRule of the Map
chat.map_rule.line2=§lDisclaimer
chat.map_rule.line3=§7When you play this map, you will agree to the precautions specified in this rule by default. We, the AB Workshop, are not responsible for all the consequences caused by violating the rules.
chat.map_rule.line4=§lVersion requirement
chat.map_rule.line5=§7Please use at least the §fbedrock version 1.20.10 or the latest China version§7 for a complete experience.
chat.map_rule.line6=§lGame mode requirement
chat.map_rule.line7=§fDefault and lock to adventure mode§7, You can unlock this lock, but just like some Android phones are not guaranteed after ROOT, we will not be responsible for the problems caused by changing the game mode.
chat.map_rule.line8=§lCommand requirement
chat.map_rule.line9=§fIt is not recommended to use any command, especially the function command that comes with the map. §7If you have related command requirements, you can unlock anti-cheating first in the Advanced Settings in the Setting Center. Commands such as /kill are §cHIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED§7, because it will seriously damage your game experience, and it is a serious cheating.
chat.map_rule.line10=§lNumber of players requirement
chat.map_rule.line11=§fSingleplayer recommended. §7We can't guarantee the stability of the map and the game experience in the case of multi-players, because after testing, the experience of multi-player play is very bad.
chat.map_rule.line12=§lDANGEROUS CONTENT WARNING
chat.map_rule.line13=§cThe theme of this map is death map, so please don't imitate the "induced suicide" behavior that may be contained in the map in reality! This is just a game!

#### Q&A
chat.help.line1=§bQ&A
chat.help.line2=Here are some questions I could think of that you might encounter. I hope they can be helpful to you~ Of course, if none of these questions are what you want to ask, feel free to ask in the comment section!
chat.help.line3=Q1: What if the map difficulty is not what I want to choose?
chat.help.line4=§7A: You can go to the Setting Center - Difficulty and Language Settings to adjust! You can also choose whether to enable hints and other auxiliary functions. (～￣▽￣)～
chat.help.line5=Q2: Why is the map so large? 40-50MB?
chat.help.line6=§7A: This is because the map has many built-in BGMs, and the music takes up most of the space QwQ
chat.help.line7=Q3: The map feels a bit laggy when playing...?
chat.help.line8=§7A: There's not much I can do about that... I've tried my best to optimize it, but a map of this size is indeed prone to lagging. It could also be due to the international or Netease high versions being laggy themselves (especially the Render Dragon). So, the solution I offer for this issue is: try playing on a different device QwQ
chat.help.line9=Q4: How did you create custom death messages? I want to learn...
chat.help.line10=§7A: You can achieve it with a simple tellraw command. If you're interested, you can dissect the map and see (I recommend doing this after you've finished playing) (～￣▽￣)～
chat.help.line11=Q5: I chose the Hard mode, but now I can't pass the level. What should I do?
chat.help.line12=§7A: Please refer to Q1 awa
chat.help.line13=Q6: Why do I only catch pufferfish when fishing? How did you do that?
chat.help.line14=§7A: I modified the loot table. Not only that, but the Piglin loot table has also been changed (awa). This version also adds more loot tables. If you're interested, you can analyze the map's addon on your own to see =w=
chat.help.line15=Q7: I've dug all over the map in level 30, but I still don't know how to pass the level...
chat.help.line16=§7A: You can check the walkthrough for this version on the @AB Workshop's Bilibili account. Make sure it's version 2.3!
chat.help.line17=Q8: So, I've completed the game after finishing all 30 levels, right?
chat.help.line18=§7A: Not quite~ I designed many things in this map, including Easter eggs, time-limited levels, and advancements. You only truly complete the game once you've finished all 30 advancements!
chat.help.line19=Q9: Where are the Easter eggs?
chat.help.line20=§7A: Since you found this, I'll give you a more obvious hint... In the starting house of the main hall, there's something fishy about the map! If you can't find it now, it's not my fault qwq, it's already very noticeable...
chat.help.line21=Q10: I want to enable coordinates...
chat.help.line22=§7A: Of course, you can! But it's a bit complicated. As you can see, this map has a forced gamerule lock. So, you need to go to the Setting Center - Gamerule lock settings, unlock the gamerule lock first, and then enable display coordinates! There's also a lot more to explore in the settings room!
chat.help.line23=Q11: How to disable the anti-cheat in this map?
chat.help.line24=§7A: Since you asked, it means you've already discovered that this map has anti-cheat =w=. But don't worry, I've set up a very user-friendly anti-cheat removal solution! Go to Setting Center - Permission Level Settings and Advanced Settings - Change Permission Level, and you can change the permission level there!
chat.help.line25=§7As long as your permission level is above 1, you can bypass the anti-cheat restrictions! Of course, if you like analyzing map commands, I recommend adjusting the level to 2, which will give you access to many underlying aspects of the map to help you dissect it.
chat.help.line26=Q12: Can I play this map in multiplayer?
chat.help.line27=§7A: The previous version couldn't, but this version... at least it has evolved to the point where it can run, but the gaming experience might be poor (QAQ)
chat.help.line28=Q13: The map is so much fun! Can I recommend it to my friends?
chat.help.line29=§7A: Of course! Absolutely! §cBut if you want to repost it, please be sure to inform me so that I am aware.
chat.help.line30=Q14: Does the author have any other maps? Can I try them out?
chat.help.line31=§7A: Of course! Join the QQ group: 673941729 to experience my latest maps!
chat.help.line32=Q15: Are you planning to release the map on NetEase?
chat.help.line33=§7A: By the time you see this, I've already detected through special means that you're using the international version awa. As for the NetEase version, I've updated this version to support it as well. NetEase players should see different content. Indeed, it wasn't easy. I moved almost all of my commands to function packs to prevent them from being blocked... QAQ
chat.help.line34=Q16: How can I contact the author?
chat.help.line35=§7A: [QQ]1543585291 | [QQ Test Group]673941729 | [Bilibili]@一只卑微的量筒 | [Bilibili | Workshop]@极筑工坊 | [Netease Version | Workshop]@极筑工坊 | [Netease Version]@YZBWDLT, @我是一只小量筒 | [International Version]@YZBWDLT | Serious inquiries only, please~ It's recommended to contact through the QQ test group.
chat.help.line36=Q17: There's a bug in the map! I'm stuck QAQ
chat.help.line37=§7A: In such situations, be sure to report it in the comments section! Or join our test group and talk to the author directly~ We'll fix the bug as quickly as possible (maybe, perhaps, possibly, seemingly, seemingly, perhaps, probably, maybe, we will, =w=)!
chat.help.line38=Q18: The map is well-done! I want to analyze the map, where should I start?
chat.help.line39=§7A: First, it should be pointed out that this map has a very complex system in operation, involving advanced commands such as execute and scoreboard, as well as Add-ons. So for beginners, dismantling this map is not an easy task... Moreover, starting from this version, all command systems in the map have been migrated to function packs, making it even more difficult to dismantle the map. If you want to analyze this map, I would give you the following steps:
chat.help.line40=§71. Finish playing the map, then redownload | 2. Execute /function settings/oplevel twice in the new map to set the permission level to 2 | 3. Execute /function developer/developer_mode to enable developer mode | 4. Use a text editor (such as VSC) to open the map folder (if on Android, you can use MT file manager or similar) | 5. Start analyzing :)
chat.help.line41=§7Good luck! If you can tackle this challenge, I believe you'll gain a lot! You're also welcome to join the test group to share your techniques~! Friendly communication, serious inquiries only!
chat.help.line42=Q19: I have other questions!
chat.help.line43=§7A: Ask in the comments section~ The author hopes everyone can be more active in the comments section qwq
chat.help.line44=Q20: Have you considered providing download links through other cloud storage services?
chat.help.line45=§7A: Of course, I have considered it! But I've always been unsure which ones are better to use. If you know a better one, feel free to recommend it to me!
