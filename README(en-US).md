Thank you for downloading this map! This map is based on Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.18.30+ requirements, so please make sure you're currently using the latest version of Minecraft, or at least higher than 1.18.30 :)

# How to Download
You can find **30种死法2 2.3** on the **Releases** page in this repository. Once you're on this page, scroll down to the bottom and choose the version you want to download according to your needs.

# How to Import

## .mcworld
As an international version player, you can directly download the .mcworld file to import the map. If you're playing on a PC, double-click the downloaded file. If you're an Android player, open it with "Text - Minecraft". If you have the Minecraft Bedrock Edition, it will automatically open and display an import pop-up. Wait for it to successfully import, and you're good to go.

## .mctemplate
If you hope to recreate this map multiple times in the future, you can download the .mctemplate file. If you're playing on a PC, double-click the downloaded file. If you're an Android player, open it with "Text - Minecraft". If you have the Minecraft Bedrock Edition, it will automatically open and display an import pop-up. Wait for it to successfully import. Then, in the world creation section, scroll down to find the imported template. You will find this world template. Use this template to directly create the map.

## .zip
If you want to manually import the map, import using the Chinese version, or simply want to study this map, you can download the .zip file. First, you'll need to decompress this package. You will get a folder titled "30 Ways to Die 2 2.3", which contains a large number of files. Then, copy this folder into minecraftWorld. However, we do not recommend importing the map in this way, for the following reasons.
* This map uses experimental gameplay, so it's not usable on the Chinese PC version because it will automatically disable experimental gameplay, rendering the map useless.
* This map (at least the three files published here) is for the international version, so it's not usable on the Chinese mobile version because the Chinese mobile version cannot open international version maps. If you want to play this map on the Chinese version, please search in the resource center. We haven't yet synchronized this map to the Chinese version at the time of its release, so please be patient. But we will do our best to upload it to the Chinese version.
* If you want to manually import into the international version, we will provide two file paths for the international version (Windows and Android). Please note that on Windows, you may need to enable the "Hidden Items" setting in File Explorer. For Android users with Android 11 or higher, accessing Android/data will be more complex. We recommend you import with MT File Manager.

* Windows minecraftWorld path:  
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\minecraftWorld
* Android minecraftWorld path:  
/Android/data/com.mojang.minecraftpe/files/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorld
